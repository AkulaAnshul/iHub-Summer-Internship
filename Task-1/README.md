Problem Statement
For GNU/Linux box: Create virtual environment, install ultralytics, and test installation with object detection and segmentation examples to verify the trained model can recognize objects and perform segmentation from online images.

Environment Setup
Operating System: Windows 11 (adapted from GNU/Linux requirements)

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Python Version: 3.12.3

Framework: YOLOv8 via Ultralytics package

Implementation Approach
1. Virtual Environment Creation
Created an isolated Python environment in VS Code to manage project dependencies without affecting the global Python installation.

2. Package Installation
Installed the ultralytics package using pip, which provides access to YOLOv8 models and functionality for both detection and segmentation tasks.

3. Object Detection Implementation
Model Used: YOLOv8l.pt (Large variant for high accuracy)

Process: Loaded pre-trained model and performed inference on test image

Output Location: runs/detect/predict/

Results: Successfully detected objects with bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels

4. Instance Segmentation Implementation
Model Used: YOLOv8l-seg.pt (Large segmentation variant)

Process: Applied segmentation model to the same test image

Output Location: runs/segment/predict/

Results: Generated pixel-level object masks with precise object boundaries

Key Achievements
Successfully set up YOLOv8 development environment

Demonstrated dual capability of detection and segmentation on same image

Verified model performance on real-world image data

Gained hands-on experience with Ultralytics framework and YOLOv8 architecture

Technologies Utilized
YOLOv8: State-of-the-art object detection and segmentation framework
Ultralytics: Python package providing YOLOv8 implementation
Visual Studio Code: Development environment with Python extension support

Learning Outcomes
Understanding of computer vision model deployment workflows

Experience with pre-trained model inference and result interpretation

Knowledge of YOLOv8 model variants and their specific use cases

Practical skills in environment setup and package management for AI projects

This task established the foundation for advanced computer vision work and demonstrated successful integration of YOLOv8 capabilities for both object detection and instance segmentation applications.
