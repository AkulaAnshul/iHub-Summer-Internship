# Task 4: Custom Dataset Creation and YOLOv8 Training on Chess Pieces

## Problem Statement

Create a custom annotated dataset from scratch, focusing on objects of interest, and train a YOLOv8 model on this custom dataset. The task involves dataset creation, annotation, and complete training pipeline implementation to understand the full machine learning workflow beyond using pre-existing curated datasets.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Dataset Conceptualization

- Domain Selection: Chess piece detection for game analysis applications
- Objective: Build a comprehensive dataset covering all standard chess pieces
- Target Classes: 12 distinct chess piece types (6 pieces × 2 colors)
- Application Focus: Chess game analysis, board recognition, and move validation systems

### 2. Image Collection Strategy

- Source: Online image repositories and chess-related content
- Diversity Criteria:
  - Multiple lighting conditions (natural, artificial, mixed)
  - Various backgrounds (wooden boards, marble, digital displays)
  - Different angles and perspectives
  - Range of chess set styles and materials
- Quality Standards: High-resolution images suitable for object detection training

### 3. Class Definition and Taxonomy

Complete Class Structure (12 Classes):
- Black Pieces: camel, elephant, horse, king, pawn, queen (Classes 0-5)
- White Pieces: camel, elephant, horse, king, pawn, queen (Classes 6-11)

Classification Logic:
- Color-based primary distinction (black vs white)
- Piece-type secondary classification
- 0-based indexing for YOLO compatibility

### 4. Data Annotation Process

Annotation Tool: Label Studio for professional-grade labeling

- Bounding Box Creation: Precise rectangular annotations around each chess piece
- Quality Control: Systematic verification of annotation accuracy
- Label Standardization: Consistent naming convention and class mapping
- Export Format: YOLO-compatible annotation format for seamless integration

Annotation Workflow:
- Import images into Label Studio workspace
- Define class taxonomy and labeling interface
- Create precise bounding boxes for each visible chess piece
- Validate annotations for accuracy and consistency
- Export in YOLO format with proper file structure

### 5. Dataset Preparation Pipeline

Automated Dataset Splitting:
- Tool: Python-based splitting algorithm
- Training Set: Primary dataset for model learning
- Validation Set: Performance evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Split Ratio: Optimized for dataset size and class balance

Configuration Management:
- data.yaml Creation: Automated generation of YOLO configuration file
- Path Management: Relative paths for cross-platform compatibility
- Class Mapping: Proper integration of 12-class taxonomy

### 6. Model Training Implementation

Training Configuration:
- Base Model: YOLOv8s.pt (Small variant for balanced performance)
- Hardware Acceleration: GPU-enabled training for efficiency
- Training Duration: 60 epochs for comprehensive learning
- Image Resolution: 640×640 pixels for optimal detection accuracy

Output Management:
- Results Directory: Dedicated directory for training outputs
- Artifacts Generated: Model weights, training metrics, validation results, loss curves

## Technical Achievements

### Dataset Quality Metrics

- Class Balance: Uniform distribution across all 12 chess piece classes
- Annotation Precision: High-quality bounding boxes with minimal label noise
- Diversity Coverage: Multiple scenarios and environmental conditions
- Format Compliance: Perfect YOLO format compatibility

### Training Performance

- Convergence: Successful model convergence over 60 epochs
- GPU Utilization: Efficient hardware acceleration implementation
- Validation Stability: Consistent performance on validation dataset
- Model Generalization: Robust performance across diverse chess piece appearances
